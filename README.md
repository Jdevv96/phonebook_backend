# Phonebook Server

A web server meant to house the data from the phonebook app previously built in the full_stack_open repo [(found here)](https://github.com/Jdevv96/full_stack_open_course/tree/main/part2/phonebook). Continuing on from the full_stack_open_course repo, and the phonebook app built within that in part2.
